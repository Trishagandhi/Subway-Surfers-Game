# Subway-Surfers-Game
The objective of this project is to develop a classic Subway Surfers Game using C# in a console-based environment. The game allows the player to navigate them to get collide from X within a specified grid, which increases the playerâ€™s score. The game ends when the player collides with the boundary walls or X.
